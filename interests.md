## scoring block
Scoring calibration:
Score ≥ 0.80 ONLY if the item clearly involves electrophysiology or physiological time series
  (EEG/MEG/LFP/iEEG/ECoG/neuronal spiking) OR aperiodic/1/f, oscillations, waveform shape,
  spectral parameterization, or neuronal timescales — OR introduces a general time-series/signal
  processing method that would transfer to those data.

If it is primarily about drugs/behavior/psychiatric symptoms without neural/physio time-series analysis,
  cap score at 0.40.

If it is primarily microbiology/immunology/metabolism/genetics without neural dynamics methods,
  cap score at 0.25. -->

## narrative
My research focuses on integrating thermoelectric devices or materials onto hypersonic or space technologies. I work extensively with ashby charts, COMSOL, and phase diagrams to extensively study important materials characteristics and if they are viable options to be functionally graded for application of a thermal protection systema and electrical power generation from available heat sources and cold sources. 






Some of my paper titles of interest include:
* Multi-Objective Robust Design of Segmented Thermoelectric–Thermal Protection Structures for Hypersonic Vehicles Using a High-Fidelity Thermal Network
* CALPHAD accelerated design of advanced full-Zintl thermoelectric device
* A Comprehensive Review of Thermoelectric Generators from Micropower Supply to Kilowatt System
* Performance and experimental investigation for a novel heat storage based thermoelectric harvester for hypersonic vehicles
* Hypersonic Vehicle Electric Power System Technology
* Electric Power Generation Onboard Hypersonic Aircraft
* Materials, Preparation, and Characterization in Thermoelectrics
* Continuity and boundary conditions in thermodynamics: From Carnot’s efficiency to efficiencies at maximum power
* Exergy analysis of integrated TEG and regenerative cooling system for power generation from the scramjet cooling heat
* Functionally Graded Ceramic Materials for High Temperature Applications for Space Planes
