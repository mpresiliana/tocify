Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 6, February 2026. <br />SignificanceMultiple modulatory systems like the serotonergic and spinal V0c interneurons studied here interact during locomotion. We demonstrate how the nervous system matches motor output to the motor demand of behaviors, and that motor demand is a ...
